# Mann-Kendall-Trend-Test
Analyzing temperature trends using the Mann-Kendall Trend Test with this Python notebook. It covers merging datasets, applying the test, and visualizing temperature changes with Sen's Slope. Uses xarray, matplotlib, and pandas.

Overview
The notebook performs the following main steps:

Data Merging and Preprocessing: Combines temperature datasets from different time periods and prepares the data for analysis.
Mann-Kendall Trend Test: Applies the Mann-Kendall Test to identify statistically significant trends in the temperature data.
Visualization: Generates time series plots of temperature fluctuations and overlays Sen's Slope trendlines to visualize the identified trends.
Dependencies
The notebook relies on the following Python libraries:

xarray
matplotlib
pandas
You can install these libraries using pip:

Bash

pip install xarray matplotlib pandas
Usage
To run the analysis:

Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
Open and run the notebook (Analyzing Trends in Temperature with the Mann-Kendall Trend Test.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Follow the instructions and execute the code cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
Datasets
The notebook assumes the presence of temperature datasets in specific formats. Ensure your data is structured similarly or modify the data loading and preprocessing steps accordingly.
